# Initial Setup

So...you set it up. What now?

Answer is...invite it to a sandbox server! Test out various cmds and once you're ready...release it. Everything about this bot- from the `.help` command to the `.restart` command is all you.

I recommend changing the help cfg settings (DmHelpString and HelpString) so you completely remove the NadekoBot branding. You can use embeds too, just use their [embed visualizer](https://eb.nadeko.bot)!


## Releasing your bot

First, setup an **invite link.** This is to add your bot to servers.

Go to your application in the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and head to the **OAuth** tab.

Select scope `bot`, Bot Permission "Administrator", then copy the invite link!

**Note: canary.discord.com and ptb.discord.com invite links redirect to discord.com. Just a notice for our multi-site using users.**

That should be good. Recruit some staff + people for your support server, and you're on your way!
